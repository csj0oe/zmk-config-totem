## ZMK Studio

1. Hold `Del` → enter Fun layer
2. Press `UNLK` (right inner bottom row)
3. Open **https://zmk.studio** in Chrome/Edge (USB) or use native app (BLE on Linux)

Studio auto-locks after ~8 min idle or on disconnect.

## Flashing

1. Push changes to GitHub → Actions builds automatically
2. Download `firmware.zip` from the Actions tab
3. Double-press reset on each half → drag `.uf2` file onto the drive
4. Flash `settings_reset` to both halves to clear BT bonds if needed
